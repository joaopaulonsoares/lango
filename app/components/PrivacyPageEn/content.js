The City of Vantaa has the right to terminate provision of the application or to prohibit access to it, if the user does not give the information essential for providing the application or if the user demands that the information be deleted.



## 5. FOR WHAT PURPOSES ARE PERSONAL DATA HANDLED

Users’ personal data are used for providing, developing and monitoring the application. The handling basis is execution of the contract, but in certain cases also the data controller's legislative obligations (The EU's General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, Article 6.1 b and c).

Handling the data does not entail automatic decision-making or profiling. The data will not be used for marketing.


## 6. WHERE THE DATA ARE ACQUIRED FROM

The data are acquired from the users when they register and use the application. Users register for the application from their Facebook account. When using their Facebook account for registering, the users give permission to receive and save the obligatory data mentioned in paragraph 4 from Facebook to the Lango application.

## 7. DISCLOSING INFORMATION

Data will not be disclosed to any third party without the customer’s consent or legislation justifying disclosing of information. In certain cases, authorities may have the right to receive data directly based on the law, for example, in order to investigate crimes.

## 8. DATA TRANSFERS

Data will not be transferred outside the European Union (EU) area or the European Economic Area (EEA). The server space was bought from an external provider, and a contract on handling personal data has been made with the service provider.


## 9. DATA STORAGE PERIOD
 
Data collected in the register will be stored for only as long as and to the extent required by the original or compatible purposes they were collected for. As a general rule, a customer’s personal data will be removed within two months from the time the customer removed his/her profile. Nevertheless, in certain cases the data can be kept longer, for example, for handling and clarifying legal claims.


## 10. INFORMATION SECURITY AND SECURITY BREACH

Office premises, systems and user data are protected with appropriate technological and administrative security measures. Permissions and access rights to data processing are personal, and their extent is defined based on work tasks. Events related to processing of personal data are monitored and any deviations notified will be reacted to. In addition, the City of Vantaa tries to prevent potential damages caused by deviations.

It is possible that, despite encryption, data may in exceptional cases end up in the wrong hands. In such a situation, the City of Vantaa will take immediate action to amend the situation. The City of Vantaa will inform the appropriate authorities and the registered persons of any security breach in a manner required by legislation. The City of Vantaa will inform of data seepage immediately or, at the latest, within 72 hours from the time the breach was noticed, if the security breach may cause significant disadvantage to users’ rights. The City of Vantaa will inform the persons whose data have leaked of the security breach. If the security breach applies to many people and the matter does not require that users take any immediate measures, the security breach can also be informed in a general announcement. 


## 11. RIGHT TO SUBMIT A COMPLAINT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY
